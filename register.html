            <li>
                <p>
                    We are strictly an anti-racist, pro-queer, radically oriented event and we hold space for that. Any behavior that goes against this will result in a ban.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    All participants must be engaged in a practice of healing, mending, or repair in some respect. We are open to hearing however you define this!

            We process applications in batches several weeks to a month prior to the next event. Application windows are shown in the table below. You can only apply for the upcoming event; to apply for a farther future event, please wait until the current application deadline has passed.

    <h3>Speaker Registration</h3>
    <div class="e-content">
        <p>The role of <dfn>Speaker</dfn> is for people who want to give a talk or lead a brief workshop on a topic that they know a bit about. As a speaker, you will be expected to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    offer your talk or workshop freely to all attendees of the Flea. (You <em>may</em> request donations for your talk, but only at the end.)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    clean up after your talk or workshop so that your allocated space is in the same or better condition than it was when it was given to you.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    fit your entire session within your allotted time. This includes set-up, tear-down, and cleaning. <em>Running late eats into other speakers&rsquo; time and is highly disruptive.</em>
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    bring all materials you need for your talk or workshop with you; there are no guarantees that any specific equipment will be available at the host venue.

            <li>
                <p>
                    use your time slot to focus on skill-sharing and mutual self-education, <em>not</em> to advertise your wares; that&rsquo;s what a <a href="#vendor-registration">vendor registration</a> is for. You&rsquo;re welcome to plug your work, but please keep it brief and do it towards the end of your session time.
