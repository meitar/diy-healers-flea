        <p>We are so excited to have you participating in the next DIY Healer&rsquo;s Flea! In order to help ensure you can easily make the most of your time at the Flea, we&rsquo;ve developed a few simple tools we would love for you to take advantage of. This page describes those tools and how you can make the best use of them.</p>
        <h3>No business cards? No problem!</h3>
        <p><img src="{{ "static/img/icon.address-book.png" | relative_url }}" alt="" width="20%" style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;" />Printing business cards can be expensive, and we know how important it is for individuals or small shops to make the most of their budget. That&rsquo;s why, when you are accepted as a participant to one of our Flea&rsquo;s, we automatically create a digital business card on our website for you based on the information in your application. In one click or tap, you can make sure your website is saved to your customer&rsquo;s or audience&rsquo;s phone.</p>
        <p>Simply point your Web browser to the Flea&rsquo;s <a href="{{ "particpants.html" | relative_url }}">Participants</a> page, scroll to the very bottom, and look for the <img src="{{ "static/img/icon.address-book.png" | relative_url }}" alt="address book icon" width="20" /> following all the participant information. Click it, and your Web browser will do the rest. Try it out for yourself, and then encourage your visitors to do the same.</p>
        <h3>Busy friends? Automatically remind them!</h3>
        <p><img src="{{ "static/img/icon.calendar.svg" | relative_url }}" alt="" width="20%" style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;" /> {{ site.next_event.venue_name }} is a fantastic place to have this event, but we know how hard it can be to remember all the event&rsquo;s details. That&rsquo;s why we want to help make sure you and the people you care about don&rsquo;t forget about the Flea, or your participation in it. In one click or tap, you can automatically subscribe to our digital calendar, and even set custom reminders for yourself, so you know exactly when and where every upcoming Flea will be.</p>
        <p>Simply point your Web browser to <a href="{{ "/" | relative_url }}">the Flea&rsquo;s homepage</a>, scroll down a bit until you see the <img src="{{ "static/img/icon.calendar.svg" | relative_url }}" alt="calendar icon" width="20" /> near the bottom of the next event&rsquo;s information. Click it, and your phone will do the rest. Try it out for yourself, and then encourage your visitors to do the same.</p>
